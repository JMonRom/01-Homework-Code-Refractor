Homework Assignment #1

When refactoring this website I noticed "Search Engine Optimization" in the header's navigation bars did not scroll to the bottom to it's appropriate location like it did for the other two options. The CSS file was also worked on to improve semantic formatting and add comments to provide easier navigation to style the website properly. Image elements were also given alt attributes to align with accesibility standards.
